# Usage: ./clean_old_deploys.sh -d <@drush_alias> -s <save_releases>
# Will keep <save_releases> number of code deploys
# based on modification date of the release directories in e.g.
# /var/www/<sitename>/releases/
#
# It also performs a check so that the currently running tag won't be removed.
#
# This script should be run periodically (daily or weekly) to keep the code deploys
# from growing out of control.
